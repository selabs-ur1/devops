# Remote meetings planning

This project is used in a course on the *ops* part at the [University of Rennes](https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/), France. It is a kind of doodle clone developed in so-called "native cloud" technologies in order to allow students to work on a continuous deployment chain in a containerized environment. Among the feature, the application automatically initializes a pad for the meeting and a chat room for the meeting participants.

- The [back](https://github.com/barais/doodlestudent/tree/main/api) is developed using the [quarkus.io](https://quarkus.io/) framework. 
- The [front](https://github.com/barais/doodlestudent/tree/main/front) is developed in [angular](https://angular.io/) using the [primeng](https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/)  angular UI component library and the [fullcalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) graphical component.

A demo of the application is available [here](https://doodle.diverse-team.fr/).

Three videos (in french) are available. They present:
